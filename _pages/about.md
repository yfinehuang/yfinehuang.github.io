<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now working on **underwater information perception and processing research**. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Information and Communication Engineering, [Guilin University of Electronic Technology (桂林电子科技大学)](https://www.guet.edu.cn/). If you are interested in any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me at <yfhuang@guet.edu.cn>. I will be recruiting master's students!

I earned my Ph.D. in **Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Ministry of Education**, [Xiamen University (厦门大学)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professors [Cheng En (程恩)](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/old/info/1021/46130.htm) and [Yuan Fei (袁飞)](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/old/info/1021/24079.htm). My postdoctoral co-supervisor is **Chen Feng (陈峰)** (Ph.D. from Harbin Engineering University). My research focuses on underwater information acquisition, underwater intelligent perception, and computation. I specialize in areas such as underwater physical imaging modeling, underwater image enhancement, underwater target detection, and polarization-based visual information perception. My work has yielded multiple research outcomes, including innovative contributions such as an underwater imaging curve reconstruction model, light attenuation compensation and multi-scale fusion enhancement algorithms, and underwater polarization-based clear imaging techniques, all of which significantly improve imaging quality and visual performance in complex aquatic environments.

On the topic of underwater visual reconstruction and image processing, I have published over 10 papers in authoritative international and domestic journals, including **_IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering_** and **_Signal Processing-Image Communication_**, etc. I have led research project funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.

I am a reviewer for **_IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology_** and **_IEEE Signal Processing Letters_**.
